 <h3>Explanation of Material Design Utilization in Chosen Design.</h3>
 
 ![system_icons](system_icons.jpg)
 
 <p>1.These icons symbolize common actions. Each icon is expressing an essential characteristic. We also use high-emphasis "on" color for the active icon in a bottom bar.<br><br>
  
 ![action_items](action_items.jpg)
  
  <p>2. On the top bar, we put the most used action on the far left, and the second most used action to its right. We also give an adequate space around system icons to allow legibility and touch.<br><br>
  
  ![floating_button](floating_button.jpg)
  
  <p>3. We use a floating button that contrast with the content to make its surface edges and shape noticeable.<br><br>
  
  ![more_symbol](more_symbol.jpg)
  
  <p>4. We use the overflow menu icon with three vertical dots to indicate the “more” symbol.<br><br>
  
  
  ![capitalized_button](capitalized_button.jpg)
  
  <p>5. We use capitalized button text labels to distinguish the text label from surrounding text.<br><br>
  
  
  ![text_label](text_label.jpg)
  
  <p>6. Text labels can also be written in sentence case, and we use another characteristic to distinguish it such as color contrast.<br><br>
